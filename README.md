## My process
I spent longer than I expected on this project because I tried using bootstrap at first and I was unsuccessful owing to the predefined colours in bootstrap. I tried to override those colours but I got stuck! I ended up using purely HTML and CSS. Don't worry I'll still use bootstrap in my future projects.  
### What I learned

While reading documentations when I was trying to use bootstrap, I came across various frontend libraries like Sass. I learnt how easy it is to install, how it  works and the benefit it offers to developers. I can't wait to learn it!
### Continued development
Although I didn't use the table tag and other related tags, I improvised by creating a table that meets the criteria and looks like the design. I didn't use the table tag because I was not able to design the table to my taste. I had to improvise!  
I'd love to see other peoples' approach to creating that table
